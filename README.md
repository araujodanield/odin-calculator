## <b>Features</b>

This calculator was built based on Windows 10 Calculator app, but just with the basic features of it. Here's a list of what is possible to do at the moment:

</br>

- <b>Basic Operations</b>: You can do the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division;

</br>

- <b>Decimal numbers</b>: It's possible to do operations with or which result in decimal numbers;
    * <i>(Note that operations that result in big decimal numbers such as "3,59999" will be automatically rounded up, so in this example, the result will be "3,6")</i>

</br>

- <b>Negative numbers</b>: You have a button that adds or removes the negative sign of a number and also works with decimal numbers;

</br>

- <b>Delete button</b>: This button allows you to delete the last number pressed, but when you have an operation result on display this button just deletes the operation, allowing you to use the result as the number of a new operation;

</br>

- <b>Clear button</b>: Clean everything made and reset the calculator;

</br>

## <b>Notes:</b>

#### - Different places around the world have different ways to represent thousands and decimals separators on numbers. For this project, I opted for using the brazilian style of formatting, so the thousands separator is represented by a dot ("."), while the decimals separator is represented by a comma (","). Example:
    "Five Million Two Hundred Thousand Six Hundred Point Thirty-five"

        USA: 5,200,600.35
        BRA: 5.200.600,35
